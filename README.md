# TodoApplication
The To-Do application allows users to add and manage tasks easily. Tasks are stored in a To-Do list with date and time, and users can update their status to In Progress or Completed using a dropdown. Tasks move between lists accordingly, can be sorted by date, and deleted once completed.
